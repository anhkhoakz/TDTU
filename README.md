Greetings and welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to the code I have learned during my time at Tôn Đức Thắng University. This collection of well-documented code serves as a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in learning programming, from students to experienced developers.

The repository is carefully organized by subject and semester to facilitate navigation and make it easy to find the code you are looking for. It contains a diverse range of topics, spanning from fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming to more advanced topics like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

I have invested considerable effort in crafting clean, well-documented, and easy-to-read code that not only solves problems but also teaches good programming practices. My hope is that this repository will serve as a valuable resource for anyone looking to enhance their programming skills.

Please feel free to explore the repository, fork it, and use the code in your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, don't hesitate to contact me.
