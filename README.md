This is my Tôn Đức Thắng University GitHub repository containing well-documented code I learned, spanning a wide range of programming topics.

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to all the code I've learned during my time at Tôn Đức Thắng University.

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of code snippets and projects that I have completed as part of my coursework, assignments, and personal projects while studying at the university. The repository is organized by subject and semester to make it easy to navigate and find the code I'm looking for.

You'll find a wide range of topics covered in this repository, from fundamental programming concepts such as data structures, algorithms, and object-oriented programming to advanced topics like artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

I've put a lot of effort into creating clean, well-documented, and easy-to-read code that not only solves the problem at hand but also teaches good programming practices. I hope that this repository will serve as a useful resource for students, developers, and anyone who is interested in learning programming.

Feel free to browse the repository, fork it, and use the code in your own projects. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
